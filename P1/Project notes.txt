Sending message data to server and saving it in a file
1. Parse json file to js format: json.parse(file)
2. Add form data to parsed json file with push function
3. Convert this data back to json using json.stringify
4. Append converted data to json file (without overwriting previously added data)

Front page content:
1. Add text and maybe a picture
3. Add footer 

TO BE FIXED: 
- Routes not working if the url doesn't have .html, why?
- Add messages table to guestbook.html, how to read json in guestbook.html to build table?
- /Sendajaxform req.body not working
- Add table structure to ajaxmessage response
